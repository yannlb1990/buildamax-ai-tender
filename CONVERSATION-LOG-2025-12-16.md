# Conversation Log - December 16, 2025

## Context
- **Project:** Buildamax AI Tender - Estimation Tool
- **Repository:** https://github.com/yannlb1990/buildamax-ai-tender
- **Working Directory:** `~/buildamax-lovable-fix` (cloned from GitHub for Lovable fixes)
- **Desktop Version:** `~/Desktop/buildamax-ai-tender` (kept separate for comparison)

---

## Session Summary

### User Request
The user wanted to continue improving the estimation tool for Lovable. They had just set up an SSH key and wanted to push fixes to the GitHub repository that Lovable uses.

### Key Decision
Keep the **Desktop version separate** from the **Lovable GitHub version** to compare the two tools after. All improvements were made to the Lovable version (cloned to `~/buildamax-lovable-fix`).

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. Scaling Issues in Estimation Tool
The user reported ongoing scaling issues with measurements when zoomed/panned.

### Root Cause Analysis
After reviewing the codebase, the following issues were identified:

1. **getPointer coordinate issue** - Using `canvas.getPointer(e.e, false)` was unreliable across Fabric.js versions
2. **Coordinate conversion was a pass-through** - `viewToWorld()` wasn't actually converting coordinates
3. **Stroke widths and font sizes not zoom-aware** - Visual elements scaled with zoom, looking inconsistent

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: getPointer Coordinate Issue
**Files:** `src/components/takeoff/InteractiveCanvas.tsx`

Changed all instances of:
```javascript
canvas.getPointer(e.e, false)  // unreliable scene coordinates
```
To:
```javascript
canvas.getPointer(e.e, true)   // raw canvas pixel coordinates
```

This provides consistent raw canvas coordinates that we then manually convert to world coordinates.

### Fix 2: Coordinate Conversion Logic
**File:** `src/lib/takeoff/coordinates.ts`

Updated `viewToWorld()` function from pass-through to proper inverse transform:

**Before:**
```javascript
export function viewToWorld(viewPoint, transform, viewport) {
  return { x: viewPoint.x, y: viewPoint.y };  // Just pass-through!
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
export function viewToWorld(viewPoint, transform, viewport) {
  // Apply inverse of viewportTransform
  const worldX = (viewPoint.x - transform.panX) / transform.zoom;
  const worldY = (viewPoint.y - transform.panY) / transform.zoom;
  return { x: worldX, y: worldY };
}
```

### Fix 3: Zoom-Aware Stroke Widths and Font Sizes
**File:** `src/components/takeoff/InteractiveCanvas.tsx`

Added helper function:
```javascript
const getZoomAwareSize = useCallback((baseSize: number) => {
  return baseSize / transform.zoom;
}, [transform.zoom]);
```

Applied to all drawing operations:
- Calibration markers and lines
- Measurement preview shapes
- Final measurement shapes and labels
- Polygon markers and lines
- Count markers

This ensures visual elements appear consistent regardless of zoom level.

## Git Commit

```
commit 9cb08ba
Author: Yann Le Borgne
Date: Dec 16, 2025

fix: Scaling issues in estimation tool

- Fix measurement drift when zoomed/panned by using getPointer(e.e, true)
  to get raw canvas coordinates and properly converting to world coords
- Add zoom-aware stroke widths and font sizes for consistent visual
  appearance at all zoom levels
- Update viewToWorld coordinate conversion to properly apply inverse
  transform (worldX = (canvasX - panX) / zoom)
```

---

## SSH Key Setup

The user set up an SSH key for GitHub access:

1. **Initial Issue:** SSH key was added as a **Deploy Key** (read-only) on the repository
2. **Solution:** Added the same key as a **Personal SSH Key** on GitHub account settings
3. **Key Location:** `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
4. **GitHub Settings:** https://github.com/settings/keys

## Completed Features (from Desktop version roadmap)

- Market Insights System (supplier database, labour rates, SOW rates)
- Price webhook system
- Measurement drift fix
- UI layout improvements (responsive grid)
- Cost Estimator component

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy via Lovable** - Sync the GitHub changes to see fixes in action
2. **Test thoroughly** - Verify measurements stay in place when zoomed/panned
3. **Compare tools** - User wants to compare Lovable version vs Desktop version

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Desktop version at `~/Desktop/buildamax-ai-tender` has additional local commits not pushed
- Lovable version at `~/buildamax-lovable-fix` is synced with GitHub
- Node.js/npm not installed on this machine - builds run through Lovable's platform
- SSH key is now set up for read/write access to GitHub
